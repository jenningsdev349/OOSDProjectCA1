# OOSDProjectCA1
GUI Java application made for my OOSD module. Made in eclipse, must be imported into an eclipse project.

The goal of this project is to create a student database. The user is able to enter a name and address, as well as checkboxes to select modules that the students are engaged in.

I received a 100% mark for this CA upon submission.
